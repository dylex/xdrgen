* Tasks [1/3]

- [ ] Try using StringTemplate to generate the code

  Having trouble installing template-haskell 2.4.0 with ghc 10.4
  (which HStringTemplate depends on).  Maybe wait until ghc 6.12
  platform is ready ?

- [X] Use Parsec.Token for the Lexer, rather than rolling my own combinators.

- [ ] Stop evaluating constants as part of the parse

   - This loses the relationship between constants which I'd like to
     preserve in the generated code

   - We should check that the definitions are consistent however.
     Maybe as a post parse pass ?
