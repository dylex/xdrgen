* Tasks [/]

- [ ] Try using StringTemplate to generate the code

- [ ] Use Parsec.Token for the Lexer, rather than rolling my own combinators.

- [ ] Stop evaluating constants as part of the parse

   - This loses the relationship between constants which I'd like to
     preserve in the generated code

   - We should check that the definitions are consistent however.
     Maybe as a post parse pass ?
